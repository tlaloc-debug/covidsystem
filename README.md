## Covid Alert System

This is a Live Demo of a system that I have proposed in my workplace that allows Human Resources Department knows if an employee presents Covid symptoms.

The idea is to have a Python Script for every employee and one Script for HR all connected to the same database.

Since the original files are written in Python, I havce created this website that mimics the behaviour of the original system.

### How to use

The green seccion is the employee side and the blue one is the HR (Admin) side.
Once the pages loads, it will show a list of all employees (5 for this demo).

You can go directly to the Admin section (blue), the ConsultA button will show you who hasn't send their answers, 
the ConsultB button will show you who has reported symptoms and the ConsultC button will generate a file (txt) with a complete report.

If you want to input data with NO SYMPTOMS clic on "I don't have symptoms".
If you have symptoms click on "I have symptoms" to select them and then click on "send"

Once you have sent your data you can play with de Admin section again, it should show you the changes.

To start over click on "Reset", this will restart the system allowing you to send new data for employee Erick Diaz
